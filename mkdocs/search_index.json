            "text": "Objects & Events\n\n\nYou know how to create beautiful maps, but you want to make it be alive by adding NPCs, treasures, etc. These elements are called \nobjects\n. These objects will also react to \nevents\n (hero action, chronometer, attack, etc.). Objects and events are here to galvanize your maps and create your game stories!\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n/!\\ Events in RPG Paper Maker are a different notion than in RM classic series.\n\n\nYou can access to events in \nSystems manager > Events / States\n.\n\n\n\n\nEvents represent the fact that something important just happened and the objects in the map can react or not to it. An event can be for example the fact that your hero pressed the action button, or even the fact that a rain tempest just started. These events are sent to objects by other objects. There are two types of events:\n\n\n\n\nSystem events\n (time, keyboard pressure, etc.) that are not sent by objects in the map, but by the game system itself.\n\n\nUser events\n (quest completed, sword hit) that you can be created by yourself and sent thanks to local objects.\n\n\n\n\nAn event also takes some \nparameters\n. For example, if you want to play a sound each three seconds in the background, you can use the time event with the parameter time = 3000 (milliseconds) and repeat = ON. Imagine such amazing things you can do with parameters (a sword hit event taking a power parameter for example). You can choose the default value of a parameter when editing parameters of an event.\n\n\n/!\\ Don't confuse physics and events. You should not use events for wind animations or gravity, etc.\n\n\nReactions\n\n\nReactions are a tree of commands that will be executed one by one. For example a command can be to display text on screen or to move specific objects in the map. Here is an example of reaction:\n\n\n\n\nThis reaction will check if the variable myValue is equal to 2. If it's OK, this will display the message \"It's OK!\". If not, this will display the message \"Go back later.\".\n\n\nTo edit / add a new command in a reaction, \nDouble click\n on a corresponding node. This will open this window containing a large list of commands:\n\n\n\n\nWe will see later all these commands details one by one.\n\n\nThere is also a way to find your commands faster with keyboard search:\n\n\n\n\nYou can also copy / paste / delete by \nRight-clicking\n on the corresponding command node.\n\n\nCommon reactions\n\n\nIf you see that you are often copying the same set of commands a lot of time maybe you should consider creating a common reaction. You can access to these in \nSystems manager > Common reactions\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis way you will be able to call this common reaction instead of always copying it. It's even taking parameters if you have some variations in your reaction.\n\n\n\n\nBlocking hero\n: If checked, the hero will not be able to move until the reaction is finished.\n\n\n\n\nObjects\n\n\nAn object is something that can move or/and react to some events in a map. So basically a tree is not an object (except if you can cut it so it would have a reaction to an axe hit) but only a static element. It can be a NPC, a monster, or anything else. Note that your hero is an object itself so you can perfectly program its reactions.\n\n\nTo add an object in a map, select the \nObject\n map editor section. Point on a map square and \nDouble click\n or press \nEnter\n after clicking on the square. This will open a new window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n: Choose a name for your objects. This can help later if you want to execute actions on this object externally.\n\n\nModel\n: Choose a model for this object. We will see later how to configure models.\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nYou can configure which event the object can react to in the \nEvents\n section. \nDouble click\n on a node:\n\n\n\n\nYou can select if you want a user or system event and change parameters value:\n\n\n\n\nSystem events are the following:\n\n\n\n\nTime\n: Event sent when time interval is cleared.\n\n\nInterval\n (default: 0): Time to wait in milliseconds.\n\n\nRepeat\n (default: ON): Send the event after each interval or once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChronometer\n: \nNot available yet.\n\n\nKeyPress\n: Event sent when pressing a key on keyboard.\n\n\nID\n (default: anything): The ID of the key.\n\n\nRepeat\n (default: OFF): If ON, this event will be sent as long as you press the key with a small offset at the first pressure.\n\n\nImmediate repeat\n (default: OFF): If ON, this event will be sent as long as you press the key without any offset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyRelease\n: Event sent when releasing a key on keyboard.\n\n\nID\n (default: anything): The ID of the key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\n\n\nAn object has a set of \nStates\n. For example, the hero can be in a normal state, or poisoned / vulnerable. Note that an object can be in several states at the same time. \n\n\nYou can add a new state on this list. There also is a \nUpdate complete list...\n button if you want to create new common states.\n\n\n\n\nFor each state, you have to choose different reactions to specific events. You can copy / paste reactions through states by using \nCopy reaction\n and \nPaste reaction\n buttons. These different options are also available for each state:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphics\n: Select the object graphics here (character picture). Choose below the kind of element (Sprite etc.).\n\n\nMoving\n: \n(not available yet)\n Options linked to the object moves.\n\n\nMove animation\n: If checked, all the frames of the character will be drawn for move animation. If not, this will only draw the first frame of the character animation.\n\n\nStop animation\n: \n(not available yet)\n If checked, all the frames of the character will be drawn for stopped animation. If not, this will only draw the first frame of the character animation.\n\n\nClimb animation\n: \n(not available yet)\n If checked, all the frames of the character will be drawn for climbing animation. If not, this will only draw the first frame of the character animation.\n\n\nDirection fix\n: \n(not available yet)\n If checked, the graphics will not change direction to look at the hero. If not, it will look at the hero.\n\n\nSet with camera\n: If checked, the graphics will update orientation according to the camera orientation. If not, the camera orientation changes nothing.\n\n\nPixel offset\n: If checked, the move animation will go 1px down after two frames. This adds an interesting effect.\n\n\nKeep position\n: \n(not available yet)\n If checked, the object always keep its position after moving, even after loading save or changing map. If not, the object position is reinitialized after loading save or changing map.\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nNot available yet.\n\n\nThe object also has a set of properties. It can be HPs, age, gender, etc. It all depends on what you need and your type of game.\n\n\nExample: create a chest\n\n\nHere is a simple way to produce a chest:\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to have a state for the chest in the systems manager when it is opened:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete reactions for each state and don't forget to replace state at the end of the normal state:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit / Copy / Paste / Delete an existing object\n\n\nYou can open a context menu by \nRight clicking\n on an object:\n\n\n\n\nModels\n\n\nModels are objects that can be commonly used. You can have models list in \nSystems manager > Models\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to add flowers that can be picked in your maps, you can create a model \"Flower\", and use this model for an empty object in your map:\n\n\n\n\nCreate model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse model flower for a map object:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault model\n\n\nThe model with ID 1 is the default model when you create a new object. You can change here the default informations to have in an object creation.\n\n\nHero model\n\n\nThe hero is also an object and reacts to a lot of systems events:\n\n\n\n\nKeyPress > Up, Down, Left, Right Hero\n: Move the object hero to the pressed directions thanks to move object command.\n\n\nKeyPress > Left, Right Camera\n: Change the camera orientation thanks to move camera command.\n\n\nKeyPress > Action\n: Send the custom event \nHeroAction\n to the facing square objects thanks to the send event command.\n\n\nKeyPress > MainMenu\n: Open the main menu thanks to the open main menu command.\n\n\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nIf an object uses a model but also has content, this new content will replace some of the model content. Models themselves can have models.\n\n\n\n\nState\n: If there is a state with the same ID, the model reactions for this state ID will be replaced by the current content.\n\n\nProperty\n: If there is a property with the same name, the model reactions for this property name will be replaced by the current content.\n\n\nEvent\n: This has no influence.",

A 3D camera offers a lot of opportunities for your scenes (moves, rotations, zooms...) and you need to know some easy basics to use it correctly.\n\n\n\n\nThe camera\n\n\nFirst, you should know what is a camera. Just imagine that you are a cameraman for a great movie. The first two things required for filming a scene are:\n\n\n\n\nThe camera position\n\n\nThe target position\n (= where the camera is looking at)\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the scripts, these two positions are always calculated thanks to algorithms. These positions will be calculated according to:\n\n\n\n\nThe \ntarget position\n and a potential \noffset\n\n\nThe \ndistance\n between the camera and the target\n\n\nThe \nhorizontal angle\n between the camera and the target\n\n\nThe \nvertical angle\n between the camera and the target\n\n\n\n\nThe distance\n\n\n\n\nThe distance is simply a positive value indicating the distance between the camera and the target. This should take account of the three axis. This will be used for zooms. The default value is 125.\n\n\nThe horizontal angle\n\n\n\n\nThe horizontal angle is only applied to the X and Z axis. For example, if you want to turn around your target horizontally, you will have to change this value. The default value is -90\u00b0.\n\n\nThe vertical angle\n\n\n\n\nSame as the vertical angle but only applied to the Y axis. For example, if you want to turn around your target vertically, you will have to change this value (to go down you have to increment the value, and to go up you have to decrease the value). The default value is 55\u00b0.\n\n\nThe move camera command\n\n\nHere we are, now that you know a bit more about the camera properties we can see how to dynamically move it. The Move Camera event command is here for it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera target\n: By default, the camera is always looking at the hero.\n\n\nUnchanged\n: Keep the current camera target.\n\n\nObject ID\n: \n(not available yet)\n If you are selecting a new object ID to focus, the camera will move to its position and will consider it as the new target after it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation\n: You can select here the kind of operation you want to apply to the modified values. For example, if you choose (+) and you set distance to 5, if the previous distance value was 125 it will become 125 + 5 = 130.\n\n\n\n\nMove\n: You can modify here the camera position on the three axis (you can choose squares by squares or pixel by pixel).\n\n\n\n\nTarget offset\n: if this option is checked, you will move the camera and the target offset positions at the same time. In 2D games, it's like if you only wanted to move the screen and ignore the hero position.\n\n\n\n\nMoving X+10 squares with target offset OFF:\n\n\n\n\nMoving X+10 squares with target offset ON:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake account of camera orientation\n: \n(not available yet)\n This is simply considering that the axis are modified according to the camera position (see the same option for \nMove Object command\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotation\n: You can here modify the horizontal and the vertical angle of the camera in order to apply rotations.\n\n\n\n\nTarget offset\n: Same as for moves.
